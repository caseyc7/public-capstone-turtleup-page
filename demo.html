        <p>
            Our application development follows an agile methodology with three planned sprints,
            with the first sprint being devoted to planning and very early initial development work,
            and the latter 2 being dedicated to full-on implementation

                                During our initial sprint, our client outlined their initial goals and plans for the project.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Integrate the app with the tracker being built by a separate engineering team</li>
                                <li>Allow users to view the location data for specific turtles in real time</li>
                                <li>Integrate existing features from the TurtleUp webpage into the app (Shop, About/Info Page)</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>
                                Additionally, the client had requested an iOS and Android compatible version of the app. The original plan
                                for this was to create 2 seperate teams, each creating their own version of the app. While this was intriguing
                                from a learning perspective, as it would allow each team to devote their full attention to each aspect of the app
                                in a full-stack capacity, it became clear this was unfeasable for multiple reasons.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Working as 2 seperate entities would not only result in increased costs for the client (depending on the different
                                design decisions that were made between teams), but would more than likely result in entirely different user experiences
                                across platforms. To remedy this, we combined into a larger overall group, while still delegating individual tasks
                                among our smaller groups. This allows us to work independently while also making sure that everyone understands the 
                                use cases and requirements correctly. We believe that this process will allow to create a more desirable product
                                for our client and the product's eventual users.

                    <h3>Technical Planning</h3>
                    <p>
                        As we decided to build a cross platform app, we decided on using React-Native to best fit our
                        needs. Other options included Swift (iOS), Flutter, or Kotlin, but those options were either not
                        suitable for our needs, or not well supported.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using React-Native presented some challenges at first, but we were able to adapt. Some of these include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understanding the basic structure of react based apps</li>
                        <li>Knowing the strengths and limitations of certain features across platforms</li>
                        <li>Understanding how to integrate with our planned backend implementation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        On the backend side of development, we opted to use Firebase from Google Cloud as our Database.
                        The main advantage of this was that Firebase was well-suited for real-time updates, which our app
                        was going to require as one of its main features. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along with this, we planned to write our backend in Golang, focusing on future stability and
                        speed, ensuring the app remains quick and easy to develop once we are no longer working on it.
                    </p>

                                By the end of sprint 1, we had successfully built a mock-prototype for the app in Figma. 
                                We presented this to our client and she was happy with the design, albiet with a few suggestions.
                                Our next steps were to begin implementing this Figma design inside of react-native.

                        Our second sprint was focused on implementing our initial figma design into an actual app.
                        To do this, we created a shared GitHub repo between the 8 of us that contained our frontend,
                        along with another for our backend. Initial setup involved setting up firebase configs and correctly
                        structuring our react-native project. Once this was complete, we were able to start delegating tasks.

                    <h3>Our Contributions</h3>
                    <p>
                        During Sprint 2, we were able to implement all of the features listed above as a larger group.
                        As a smaller group, however, we were tasked with building the home page, sign in page, and parts
                        of the info/about page.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Home Page</h4>
                    <div class="content-with-image">
                        <div class="text-content">
                            <p>
                                The main goal with the home page was to display all of the turtles we stored in our DB in
                                an intuitive manner. The way we decided to design this was to format each turtle document from
                                Firebase into its own "card" that contained all/most of the information contained in the schema.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                We also wanted to make the page somewhat interactive, so we decided on adding a "My Turtles" and
                                "Explore Turtles" tab at the top of the page. The Explore tab would display all turtles to any user, 
                                and the My Turtles tab would display only turtles that are connected to the user. While it has not yet
                                been decided how turtles will be connected to users from a business perspective, our next steps for this
                                page will be actually filtering turtles based on the currently logged in user.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                Lastly, icons were added that represent a photo and a map. The photo icon loads an image (specific
                                to the turtle you are currently selecting) from a Firebase storage bucket, and displays it to the user.
                                The next step for this function will be to cache the photos on device to prevent too many reads to the bucket
                                itself. The map icon currently redirects the user to the map page. The next steps for this feature will be
                                to display the selected turtle's location data on screen after being redirected.

                                The main challenge with the home page was understanding home Firebase handles User Auth.
                                Becuase the service already has its own built in way to handle authentication, we decided to use 
                                this feature for out own app. Once we understood how to use the packages Firebase provides for
                                working with react-native, most of the work came down to styling and making the page look visually
                                appealing
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There was some communication that had to occur between both sides of the larger group. Most of this
                                happened due to resolving issues connecting the signup and login process, as well as understanding
                                how to use oAuth for allow for signing in with Google, which ultimately presented some issues with cost
                                and cross-compatability.

                                found on the website, but formats it in a way that is more accessible for mobile apps
                                while making the info easier to access, especially as the user is already on the app.

                    <p>
                        At the conclusion of our second sprint, we had the impression that our overall product reached
                        the base standards that we expected for ourselves. We had implemented a MVP and even gone slightly
                        beyond that. Sprint 3 was focused on enhancing already created features and developing new features
                        that would allow for future development and a more advanced user experience.

                                <li>An admin page that will allow for future TurtleUp employees to manage the app without accessing code</li>
                                <li>Added features to the home page that link specific turtle cards to pins on the map</li>
                                <li>An enhanced about page that contains more detailed information about the company, like social media handles</li>
                                <li>Integration with a pre-existing mailchip service to allow to Newsletter signup directly in our app</li>
                                <li>Various behind-the-scenes improvements to enhance performance and general good coding practices</li>

                    <h3>Our Contributions</h3>
                    <p>
                        The below sections go more in depth on the features that we implemented this sprint.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Home Page</h4>
                    <div class="content-with-image">
                        <div class="text-content">
                            <p>
                                The home page was in a good spot at the end of sprint 2. The main features we wanted to implement were the ability
                                to link specific turtles cards to a map-page redirect. More specifically, selecting a turtle's 
                                <ion-icon name="map"></ion-icon> icon would take the user to that particular turtle on the map page,
                                making it easier to locate each turtle on the map.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                Last sprint, we did not get around to fully implementing the "My Turtles" feature, which somewhat existed,
                                but was still mostly hard-coded into the app. This sprint, with the help of Team 13, we were able to implement the ability to "like"
                                specific turtles that would appear in a users "My Turtles" section as long as they were logged in. Team 13 also aided in
                                allowing for QR code scans to like turtles, allowing the users 2 options for using this feature (pressing <ion-icon name="heart"></ion-icon>
                                or scanning a QR code).

                    <h4>Sign Up Page (Newsletter Implementation)</h4>
                    <div class="content-with-image">
                        <div class="text-content">
                            <p>
                                The signup page was mostly implemented last sprint, with the only feature missing was connecting the
                                newsletter signup checkbox to an actual api endpoint. This sprint, we spent time talking with our client to
                                learn about their current newsletter signup implementation and how it works.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After learning that TurtleUp is using mailchimp, we began implementing an API route that would allow us to
                                connect to TurtleUp's already existing mailchip service. This way, a user could opt to sign up for the newsletter
                                directly in the app. This posed challenges in learning how to set up an API to an external service other than our DB,
                                which had already been set up. However, we were able to perform testing with a seperate Mailchimp account and eventually
                                connect that to the real mailchimp service once that was fully working. We also added fields to the sign-up page
                                for first and last name to allow for personalized newsletters.
                            </p>

                                The changes made to the about page for this sprint were mostly about ease-of-use and 
                                quality of life. The main feature implmented here was hyper-links to each of TurtleUp's 
                                social media platforms. These include Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook, Youtube, and
                                the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We also spent a considerable amount of time conforming the about page, along with the rest
                                of the app, to TurtleUp's brand kit specifications. Most notably in regards to color, which
                                we were finally able to confidently specify as <span style="color: #ea8350; font-weight: bold;">Hex Code #ea8350</span>

                        <p>
                            Along with the above features, we completed some smaller code re-factors meant to enhance
                            user experience and future expansion of the app. One of these was allowing the products stored in
                            our shop page to be pulled directly from our DB. Previously, we had products statically stored in 
                            the assets folder of our app. Now, we have a schema in firebase that links to photos stored in a 
                            google cloud storage bucket. This will allow for future products to be easily added and removed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When this was first implemented, there were issues with requests being sent to firebase for a new collection
                            of images even when all of those images had been read and downloaded already, resulting in redundant requests
                            that could eventually lead to excess costs and storage issues. Now, the images are grabbed when the page is 
                            initally loaded and only re-downloaded in the user leaves and re-enters the page.

                    <h3>Overall</h3>
                    <p>
                        We felt that working with TurtleUp was an incredibly rewarding experience. Being given the opportunity
                        to build an app of this magnitude was a significant challenge that we believed prepared us for future 
                        projects and challenges we may encounter
                    </p>
                    <h4>Future Considerations</h4>
                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>
                            There were some things we could have done differently, but we largely believe that the way we tackled the project 
                            was well thought out considering our experience with these technologies and platforms at the time of the project beginning.
                            One thing in particular that we could have tackled differently was completing documentation along the way.
                            Specifically, creating documentation for new features as we created them. We always knew this was going to be a project
                            that would be passed on to future capstone groups, so documentation has always been a necessity, and creating the documentation
                            early on would have caused less headaches at the end of the project while attempting to rememeber everything we did.

                    <h4>Closing Thoughts</h4>
                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>
                            As this app gets passed down to future groups, it will be interesting to see how they begin to tackle challenges like
                            itegration with a real satellite tracker, which has always been the end goal for this project. While we did not get to take this
                            on ourselves, we feel confident that we left the project in a good enough spot that future features can be (relatively) easily implemented.
